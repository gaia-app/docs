## About the technical choices

To develop Gaia, we chose a technical-stack that we were confortable with, to be able to develop quickly, be efficient, and to avoid struggling with a language or stack we don't know.

So we chose to develop mainly in Java, with Kotlin for some cool features (data classes, extension methods, pattern matching), and in VueJS for the front stuff.

The runner architecture is inspired by Gitlab-CI.
